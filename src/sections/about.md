I am an impatient learner, always curious, and working on various projects at once. I believe leadership is not just about having a lead title, but empowering people to work at the intersection between team goals and personal goals. Help groups of people achieve things that persons alone cannot. All that while being authentic, having fun and celebrating diversity and individualism.

Being curious, inspiring others and helping others grow can happen at any point in your career. Leadership skills are beneficial in all roles.. as a product manager, as senior.. you need to think and act as a leader anytime you are interacting with others in your organization.

When I became a senior a lot of people told me I could become a lead, I didn't feel like I knew enough about it to just transition. On the other side I also know people who take on anything believing they can just do it. Sometimes resulting in the people that they are managing feeling unsupported as their manager is going through their own learning journey. I was grateful to have the 2 days leadership course offered at my company but I knew there was so much more that I needed to learn. And I continued educating myself on this afterwards. 

The same as we need to continue learning in the field of computer science or data science we need to continue learning in the field of leadership. What we know about people changes, what incentives people also changes. Different people, different situations need different types of leadership. People are unique and the challenges we face as leaders may require unique solutions that you won't find in books or general leadership courses. What I can support you with is helping you with your unique growth path in leadership. Figuring out which skills you need, growth areas you have and potential blind spots.

I've worked for many years in the data field and have gone through various roles and only occasionally I've worked with leaders that I admired and wanted to learn from. There is a long way to go till our industry realizes that investing in building leadership skills is even close to as important as let's say data science skills, or coding skills.

My goal is to increase the number of good leaders out there.. as we do spend a lot of time at work and it is important that this time has a positive impact on our lives and on others.
